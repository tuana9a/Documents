### Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)

The most well known MTA (software that is used to transfer electronic messages to other systems) is Sendmail. Postfix is another popular one and aims to be simpler and more secure than Sendmail.

### Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)

Also called the Local Delivery Agent, it takes care of storing the email in the userâ€™s mailbox. Usually invoked from the final MTA in the chain.

### POP/IMAP Server

The Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) are two communication protocols that let an email client running on your computer talk to a remote server to pick up the email.
