GET vs POST

GET
    In case of Get request, only limited amount of data can be sent because data is sent in header
    Get request is not secured because data is exposed in URL bar
    Get request can be bookmarked
    Get request is idempotent
        It means second request will be ignored until response of first request is delivered	
    Get request is more efficient and used more than Post
    VD:
        GET/RegisterDao.jsp?name1=value1&name2=value2
        <headers>
        // các header
        // thông tin request dễ dàng bị expose (bắt và phân tích, đọc được,...)
    other
        get remains in the browser history
        get can be bookmarked
        get can be cached
        get have length restrictions
        get should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
        get should only be used for retrieving the data
POST
    In case of post request, large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body
    Post request is secured because data is not exposed in URL bar
    Post request cannot be bookmarked
    Post request is non-idempotent
    Post request is less efficient and used less than get
    VD:
        POST/RegisterDao.jsp HTTP/1.1
        <headers>				
        // các header
        <body>
        name1=value1&name2=value2
        // thông tin nằm trong body (content) nên an toàn hơn
    other
        post requests cannot be bookmarked
        post requests have no restrictions on length of data
        post requests are never cached
        post requests do not retain in the browser history
