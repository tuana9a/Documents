dùng để truyền data (request, response, text, ảnh, audio, video,...)
"It is stateless means each request is considered as the new request
    In other words, server doesn't recognize the user by default"
feature
    "HTTP is media independent: It specifies that any type of media content can be sent by
        HTTP as long as both the server and the client can handle the data content."
    "HTTP is connectionless: It is a connectionless approach in which HTTP client
        i.e., a browser initiates the HTTP request and after the request is sent
        the client disconnects from server and waits for the response."
    "HTTP is stateless: The client and server are aware of each other during a current request only.
        Afterwards, both of them forget each other.
        Due to the stateless nature of protocol, neither the client nor the server
            can retain the information about different request across the web pages."
