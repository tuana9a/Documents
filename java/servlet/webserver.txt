    If the requested web page at the client side is not found
        then web server will sends the HTTP response: Error 404 Not found.
    When the web server searching the requested page if requested page is found
        then it will send to the client with an HTTP response.
    If the client requests some other resources then web server will contact to application server
        and data is store for constructing the HTTP response. (mp3, mp4, jpeg, service)
            and maybe web container did join this process
